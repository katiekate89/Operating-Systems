The main function of an operating system is being the communicator between the person using the computer and the actual computer.
The operating system is a software that basically translates what the person using the computer is trying to do to the computer they're using.
It provides a platform for the person using the computer to use programs in a streamlined way.
The operating system provides security to the computer and the computer users data.
The operating system provides this security by recognizing when an unknown user is trying to access content on the computer and requires them to input a password.
Unauthorized access to a computer is just one line of defense that the operating system provides.
